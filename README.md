# SMART_IRRIGATION_WEEK1
# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System using AI

This project is developed as part of the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship Program (Jul–Aug 2025)**, focused on building **Green Skills using AI Technologies**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Irrigation System** leverages Artificial Intelligence to optimize water usage in agriculture. By analyzing environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, this system predicts the optimal watering schedule to conserve water and ensure healthy crop growth.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to analyze weather and soil data.
- Predict irrigation requirements based on real-time conditions.
- Develop a solution that supports sustainable agriculture using AI.

## 📊 Features

- 📈 **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis on environmental factors.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Model trained to predict irrigation needs.
- 📉 **Visualization**: Plots for better understanding of data patterns.
- ✅ **Decision Making**: Smart recommendation on when and how much to irrigate.
